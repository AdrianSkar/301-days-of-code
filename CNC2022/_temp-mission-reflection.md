# Reflection questions

### MISSION # ___

1. What are the categories of work you're doing? Most of your tasks will likely fall into a handful of categories, like: research, communication, coding new features, coding familiar features, installation. What categories showed up in this mission?
	

2. Time estimates by category Look at your time estimates per category. Are there any categories that you estimated accurately in this mission? Are there any that were completely off? If so, what do you think contributed to the time difference?
	

3. How well did the schedule work? Assuming you had at least two work sessions as part of this mission, how did your proposed schedule work out? Do those times of the day, or days of the week, work well for you in the future? Do you want to try a different schedule?
	

4. How was your work environment? What worked about your environment? Were you comfortable? Distracted? Tired? Focused? Anything you might do differently to create a more productive work environment for your next session?
	

5. Goal adjustment Now that you've finished your first mission, did you reach your goals? Do you need to make adjustments for the next? What about due dates? It's ok if goal posts move or you need to redefine your expectations. Take a moment to reflect.
	

6. How did the coding go? This challenge is all about coding more, so how did that go? Was there anything that got you particularly stuck? Did you feel excited about this week's coding? Intimidated? Frustrated? Did you have the tools you needed, or do you need to take a moment and gather some resources? What might you do in the next mission to make your coding more productive?
	

7. Other notes. Anything else you want to capture about this mission?
