# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 0: [13th Jan 2022]

**Today's progress:**
- Set up repo and ClickUp (project management tool) tasks for the project.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently working, managing things at home and involved in other learning resources but I think the challenge will help me establish the habit of coding every day. I hope this project helps me become a good programmer and get a job in which I can learn, grow and enjoy.
