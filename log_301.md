# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

---
### Day 11: [10 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Practiced some CSS selectors https://flukeout.github.io/ @flukeout
- Keeping up with #CNC2022's mission 2
- Reviewed bash date man

**Thoughts:** 
\#CNC2022's mission 2 can be challenging (setting up clear goals and planning). Fortunately I already have experience managing my study/work tasks using a project manager.

---
### Day 10: [09 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Catching up with @ChrisFerdinandi's JS tips. 
- Continuing with "Refactoring UI".

**Thoughts:** 
Busy day with some home issues. Those UI tips might seem a divergence but they're pretty in line with what I'm currently learning (DOM, JS).
I'm reading Refactoring UI when I have the time at night; it also seems a detour but, from what I've seen, it might help on my next projects and portfolio.

### Day 9: [08 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
Extremely busy day today + some bad news. Managed to review some study
techniques and a couple of JS concepts.

---
### Day 8: [07 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Started #CNC2022 mission 2.
- Managing workspaces and setups.
- Filename conventions.

**Thoughts:** 
Busy day at work but I think I've started to set up properly #CNC2022's
mission, some settings in my workspace and learned some more about portfolios
and filename conventions.

**Links:**
- [Google dev filename convention](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames)
- ["Of spaces, underscores and dashes" by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/of-spaces-underscores-and-dashes/)

### Day 7: [06 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Continuing with debouncing.
- Rediscovered [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) (@iliakan)
- Trying the pomodoro technique.

**Thoughts:** 
I'm going to add javascript.info to my list of resources as it seems to be a great resource. 
I'm starting to implement the pomodoro technique in my study sessions so I can
test if it helps focusing and managing time and tasks.

### Day 6: [05 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Learning about PubSub design patterns, scroll events and debouncing.

**Thoughts:** 
Busy day but managed to study some hours. I need to get better managing time but I'm improving.

### Day 5: [04 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Learning about PubSub design patterns @prof3ssorSt3v3.
- Reviewed some CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** 
New concepts are the hardest, I've spent almost all my study time with a single lesson on PubSub design patterns, hope it's worth it.

### Day 4: [03 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Reviewed VSCode snippets and other settings.
- Started reading Refactoring UI by @adamwathan and taking a look at @tailwindcss.
- Learned about functions and the Resize Observer API with @prof3ssorSt3v3

**Thoughts:** 
Other tasks involved getting some info on Magisk updates (dealing with Android rooted phones), Zapier automations.

### Day 3: [02 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- A lot of work in my main job today but managed to review some CSS; specificity, rules + found out that the order of the value in the border property does not matter.

**Thoughts:** 
I also discovered some coders streaming on Twitch, pretty insightful to be able to watch their workflow and thinking process.

### Day 2: [01 Feb 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Completed #CNC2022 Mission 1.
- Established clear time goals and tools.
- Built a small [Add/subtract days from date calculator](https://dev.to/adrianskar/addsubtract-days-from-date-calculator-35j9) because I wondered when
  the challenge would end.

**Thoughts:** 
\#CNC2022's mission one helped me realize my main assumptions for this challenge and where I could start tackling related difficulties. I'm also trying to be more open with the learning experience by publishing on dev.to.

### Day 1: [31 Jan 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Started both #301DaysOfCode and #CNC2022 CodeMore challenge from CodeNewbie.
- Reviewed markdown and proper MLA citations.
- Completed #CNC2022 pre-mission.
- Learned some more about JS arrays with @midudev

**Thoughts:** After a sick leave from Day 0, I'll finally be able to commit to the challenge. Hope my target goals and projects as self-taught dev are the correct ones. I'll need to get more orientation on that too. Fortunately enough, the #CNC2022 seems to provide some of that orientation.

### Day 0: [13 Jan 2022]
**Today's progress:**
- Set up repo and ClickUp (project management tool) tasks for the project.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently working, managing things at home and involved in other learning resources but I think the challenge will help me establish the habit of coding every day. I hope this project helps me become a good programmer and get a job in which I can learn, grow and enjoy.
