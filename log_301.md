# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 2: [1st Feb 2022]

**Today's progress:**
- Completed #CNC2022 Mission 1.
- Established clear time goals and tools.
- Built a small [Add/subtract days from date calculator](https://dev.to/adrianskar/addsubtract-days-from-date-calculator-35j9) because I wondered when
  the challenge would end.

**Thoughts:** 
\#CNC2022's mission one helped me realize my main assumptions for this challenge and where I could start tackling related difficulties. I'm also trying to be more open with the learning experience by publishing on dev.to.

### Day 1: [31st Jan 2022]

**Today's progress:**
- Started both #301DaysOfCode and #CNC2022 CodeMore challenge from CodeNewbie.
- Reviewed markdown and proper MLA citations.
- Completed #CNC2022 pre-mission.
- Learned some more about JS arrays with @midudev

**Thoughts:** After a sick leave from Day 0, I'll finally be able to commit to the challenge. Hope my target goals and projects as self-taught dev are the correct ones. I'll need to get more orientation on that too. Fortunately enough, the #CNC2022 seems to provide some of that orientation.

### Day 0: [13th Jan 2022]

**Today's progress:**
- Set up repo and ClickUp (project management tool) tasks for the project.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently working, managing things at home and involved in other learning resources but I think the challenge will help me establish the habit of coding every day. I hope this project helps me become a good programmer and get a job in which I can learn, grow and enjoy.
