# 301 days of code challenge

**UPDATE**

As I wasn't able to keep up with [the challenge](./log_301.md) last time, I've repurposed my test/notes [repo](https://github.com/AdrianSkar/code-hub) into a code journal too. The objective is to turn it into a playground that serves as a test field, notes archive and journal that allows for learning, practicing and building a code habit all on the same place.
