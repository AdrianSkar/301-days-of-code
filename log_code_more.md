## [Mission 1](./CNC2022/1.mission-one.md) (2205)

_I want to code more mainly because_ I enjoy creating things and solving problems but my main goal is to get a job in the field.
	
_I know I'll have reached my "code more" goal_ when I finally land that job.
	
_My top three assumptions for reaching my goal are_ that I'll have enough time, energy and motivation to do so.

_Of these assumptions, my riskiest is_ time, I'm working part-time and also taking care of things at home so spare time is really scarce.
	
_When I think about my riskiest assumption, three possible root causes are_ work, chores and relatives. They really need their own chunk of time and neglecting any can result in pretty negative consequences. 

_3 ways I might address these root causes are_ chunking small tasks together so they don't take attention and time later on, relying more on others to do common tasks and chores, and managing work (as much as I can) in a manner that I can give more priority to coding, even if that means earning a little less.

_Of these, the biggest cause that's worth tackling first is_ relying more on others. Financially, I can't take much time from work and I think I have relatively strong time management skills but I don't usually ask for help when it comes to other tasks and chores.

### Determine what has worked
>If your goal is to code more, then we assume you've coded in the past. Think about the times you've been happy with what you've coded â€” [briefly elaborate,] jot down three things that went well. . . . [and] three reasons why that was a happy coding session. 

The best times I recall enjoying coding have been those on which I was improving something I was working on or solving a specific issue. The most satisfying thing was the relief sensation of not having to do 'X' any more and/or knowing I would save time and effort on non-productive tasks. 
I also like the 'click' moments when I've learned something more profoundly than before.
I worked as consistently as I could as I felt driven to solve that issue once and for all and found more helpful related tools along the way. 
Those sessions also helped me learn to distinguish between tool features and when to choose which.

### Determine what has NOT worked
>What's a coding moment in the past that didn't turn out the way you hoped? Write down three things that you were unhappy about. . . .[and] three reasons why those unhappy things happened.

There have been moments when I just didn't have the time to solve a problem, others when I felt frustrated and stressed enough to opt for the most quick/dirty solution instead of taking the time to reflect on the situation and seize the opportunity to grow with it. On other occasions I just didn't have the knowledge to implement the idea or even know where to start; those projects could/have ended up on a forgotten to-do list that I intent to recover 'some day'.

### Long-term goals
>Your goal is to code more, but what does that look like for you? Write down what you hope to accomplish in 6-12 months. . . .

I aim to make coding a priority and, given my current situation (working part time and managing things at home) I think a reasonable goal would be to code and learn for about 20 hours a week so I can get a junior job by the end of the year or, at least, be close to to getting one.

### Short-term goals
>[And in] about 5 weeks long [?]. . . How does it relate to your long-term goals? . . . 

In 5 weeks I expect to have made coding a solid habit regardless of time spent on it and given it the priority I needed for long-term goals.
